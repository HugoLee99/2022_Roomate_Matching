Our project is divided into three parts, web designing, database storing and matching algorithms. 
Relative information such as habit and interest can be entered and the result can be shown through the the web designing part. As for the database storing part, a MySQL database that connects to web is used to store the information with two exel tables. Then the information will be transmitted to the algorithm part to run. Finally, the result is shown in the web part.
